# Python Trivia Game

Welcome to my **Python Trivia Game**! This is my first project using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, where I've applied foundational OOP principles to create a fun and engaging trivia experience. The game challenges players with a series of questions across various topics, and players aim to answer correctly to earn points. 

## Features

- **Multiple Categories**: Includes questions on a range of topics.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps a score of correct answers.
- **Object-Oriented Structure**: Leverages OOP for clean, organized code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:

2. **Run the game**:

### How to Play

- Run the game and answer each question by typing True or False.
- Each correct answer awards you points. Try to get the highest score possible!
- The game ends when you've answered all questions.

## Future Improvements

Since this is my first OOP project, I'm looking forward to creating a more advanced version of this project with features such as:

- **Leaderboard System**: Tracking top scores across multiple sessions.
- **Timer**: Adding a countdown for each question to increase challenge.
- **GUI Version**: Eventually transitioning to a graphical interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Object-Oriented Programming Principles**

## Lessons Learned

- will update after I finish the project
